//! `EngineHandle` — singleton process-wide owner of the composing engine.
//!
//! Per plan §3.4 (Codex (a) APPROVED): one `Mutex<Engine>` per process.
//! Both reference IMEs (McBopomofo `KeyHandler`, khiin-rs `EngineController`)
//! converge on this pattern.
//!
//! Generation-mismatch semantics (plan §5b.2): the platform increments
//! `Request.generation` only on a real field change (per §4.2 fallback
//! rules); on mismatch the engine silently drops state to Idle BEFORE
//! applying a mutating request. NO effects emitted from the drop itself —
//! the request's own effects then apply against fresh state.
//!
//! Read-only intents (`Intent::is_read_only`: `FetchAtPos`)
//! never mutate. A platform may run the candidate search on a worker
//! thread (Android does), so a fetch can finish after the main thread has
//! already moved the engine to a newer generation. Letting that stale
//! fetch reset the engine would wipe the new context's composing state;
//! instead a mismatched read-only request answers `Engine::idle_snapshot`
//! and leaves both the state and `last_generation` alone. A matching one
//! runs against a clone of the engine with the mutex released, so the (up
//! to tens of ms) dictionary scan never blocks a concurrent main-thread
//! `Append` / `DeleteBackward`. A fetch that runs in passes (the user-data
//! re-rank) takes that clone once ([`EngineHandle::engine_at`]) and answers
//! every pass from it, so the rows it read describe the state it answers.
