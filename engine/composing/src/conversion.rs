//! Hanji conversion of a TPS pending tail
//! (`docs/architecture/desktop-tps-hanji-conversion-roadmap.md` H1, H2): the
//! walker's best path over the closed readings, kept in `Phase::Continuous`
//! and shown in the preedit in front of the glyphs of the reading still being
//! typed.
//!
//! A reading is closed by its tone mark, or by Space for tones 1 and 4. The
//! closed part is the longest prefix of the tail ending on such a boundary
//! that the syllabifier reaches from the start of the tail; it is walked as
//! a buffer of its own, so its trailing Space keeps the §41 tone pin and a
//! tail the whole-buffer walk cannot span still converts what is closed.
//!
//! The caret moves by word over the converted words and by glyph inside the
//! text between them (H3). A reading typed inside the tail keeps the words
//! on both sides until it closes; then the whole tail is walked again.
//!
//! The list of the word before the caret starts at [`word_list_start`];
//! its pick nails what the preedit shows before that start (H4). A walk
//! ranks with the user's learned counts when the request supplies them
//! ([`ConversionFrequency`], H5).
