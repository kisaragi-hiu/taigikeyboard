# Build the universal macOS `RustTaigi.xcframework` (arm64 + x86_64) and stage it,
# with the swift-bridge generated `RustTaigi.swift` / `RustTaigiDesktop.swift` /
# `SwiftBridgeCore.swift`, into the stable path `macos/RustEngine/`.
#
# The macOS IME (SwiftPM executable, see docs/architecture/macos-roadmap.md D1/D2)
# consumes the xcframework as a `binaryTarget` named `RustTaigi`; the Swift
# wrappers are compiled as sources of the `RustTaigiSwift` target.
#
# The archive is `macos/crates/taigi-macos-ffi` (its own workspace, `macos/`):
# the engine's `engine/swift-ffi` bridge, linked as an rlib, plus the desktop
# shell's bridge, in ONE static library so the engine's process-wide state
# exists once (docs/architecture/macos-desktop-core-roadmap.md D1).
# `engine/swift-ffi` is shared with iOS; `make build`
# runs this script and `build-xcframework.sh` together so both platforms'
# artefacts stay in step.
#
# The swift-bridge post-processing itself lives in
# scripts/lib/swift-bridge-artifacts.sh, shared with the iOS build.
