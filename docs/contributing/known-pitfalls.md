# Known Pitfalls

Technical rules distilled from past incidents. The dated narratives that produced them live in `docs/architecture/incident-log.md`.

## Tests and diagnosis

- **Trace before assert**: compute an expected value from the real tables (`engine/phonetics/src/tables.rs`), never from the code's actual output. `tables::tl_tone_mark` returns "" for tones 1 / 4, so `tl::to_tl` leaves those syllables unmarked.
- **Fixture rule**: a syllabifier / continuous-fetch / golden fixture exercising syllable `X` must also include every production syllable that is a strict prefix of `X` and assert its absence (or presence). Confirm against production artifacts via `engine/composing/tests/candidate_dump.rs` first.
- **Fix-location rule**: display-only candidate strips belong in the span-local key builder (`composing::shadow::left_anchored_keys_and_restrictions`), never in `syllabifier::valid_span_endings` — touching the primitive reintroduces the `span_min_syllable_count("tania")` regression.
- **Verify pipeline claims**: grep production data and run a real query before trusting a document's "current behaviour". `dictionary/common/notone.py::remove_tone()` already strips digits and hyphens; `dictionary/build/merge_csv.py` `groupby((hanzi, _tl_key))` already enforces `(hanzi, tl)` uniqueness.
- **Unmerged or unbuilt prerequisites**: a path whose prerequisite PR has not merged, or whose binary was not rebuilt, never ran — static analysis is not verification.
- **Three failed fixes for one bug**: stop adding mitigations and compare against a working reference (`references/aiongtaigi-sushi`, `references/florisboard`). The Android IME window uses platform-default insets, never `MATCH_PARENT × MATCH_PARENT` plus a custom inset.
- **Spike a platform capability before planning on it**: a third-party iOS keyboard extension never receives hardware-keyboard `UIPress` events (`pressesBegan` on `UIInputViewController` is dead on device; iPadOS delivers them to the host app only), so iPad external-keyboard composing is impossible in the extension. Any plan resting on an unverified OS capability starts with a ≤20-line on-device spike.

## Review and device gates

- A diff carrying numeric / geometry fidelity risk (wide caller surface, unit conversion) gets a dedicated line-by-line review — a double `toInt()` truncation once passed a design-level review.
- Qualitative perf gate: **S1 POJ diacritics**, **S2 TPS composition**, **S3 Hanji candidate scroll**, plus the iOS keyboard-extension 64 MB hard cap, leak-free, no keyboard dismiss. Per-feature `Sn` items live in `docs/architecture/dogfood-checklist.md`; root-cause receipts in `docs/architecture/behavioral-invariants.md`.

## Design

- Read the module's entry point (`api.rs` / `requests.rs`) before proposing integration; `engine/nextword` only filters / scores what the platform feeds, it fetches nothing.
- Cite best practices from `docs/references/mainstream-ime-comparison.md` first. Proven cites: `references/khiin-rs/khiin/src/buffer/buffer_mgr.rs` (commit-and-resegment), `references/librime/src/rime/...` (segment status state machine), `references/aiongtaigi-sushi` / `references/florisboard` (IME window / inset).

## Phonetics

- Never remove or infer a TL / POJ / TPS rule from dictionary or test absence (`docs/contributing/phonetics.md`). `iri` / `erk` / `eeh` are dialectal finals (`knowledge/taigi-phonetics-reference.md` §3.2.6). TPS has its own tone marks (`engine/phonetics/src/tps.rs::ZHUYIN_TONES`) — not digit tones, not bopomofo.

## Privacy

- No personal identifier in any tracked file, commit message, PR or issue: no email address, no account / project / server ID — write "a former work address", "the maintainer's author email". gitleaks' `personal-email` rule (`.gitleaks.toml`) and the maintainer's private denylist (`scripts/private-denylist-scan.sh`) gate commits; neither sees PR bodies or issues, so check those by hand.
- Tooling bound to a personal account (mailbox triage, chat-server triage, OAuth clients, runtime state) lives outside this repository, never under `.claude/`.
