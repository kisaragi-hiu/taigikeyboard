/// The full-width punctuation policy: which typed characters become full-width,
/// and when the mapping applies at all.
///
/// Applied only while the Hanji/romanization swap has Hanji coming first, mirroring the
/// MOE input method's rule (full-width in Hanji mode, half-width in TL mode): romanized output reads
/// as Latin text and keeps Latin punctuation, Hanji output reads as CJK text
/// and gets CJK punctuation. That mode IS the whole gate — there is no
/// setting beside it (USER 2026-08-24) — and it was written as the exact
/// complement of the auto-space gate: auto-space served the
/// roman-first mode, this mapping the hanji-first one.
///
/// Since the Hanji/romanization key (2026-08-25) they can meet. Space commits a romanization
/// while the settings lead with hanji, which earns a trailing space in the very
/// mode this mapping serves, so a following `?` matches both rules. The
/// auto-space swap is read first and wins: the word in front of the caret is
/// romanization, and romanization keeps Latin punctuation whatever the mode
/// would say about a hanji word (the key path reads the swap before the map).
/// The mode is the only switch: no chord types the other width (USER
/// 2026-10-07). TPS is full width only; there ⌃ on a key of this map types its
/// mark (`KeyEventSnapshot.tpsPunctuationChord(inputMode:)`) and the swap
/// attaches the full-width glyph.

    /// double quote serves as both opening and closing so a one-to-one map
