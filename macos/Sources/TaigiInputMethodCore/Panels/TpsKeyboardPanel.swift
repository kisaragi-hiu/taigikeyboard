/// The panel the `showTpsKeyboard` chord asks for (desktop TPS roadmap D6):
/// up while TPS is typed and the user wants it (`SettingsStore.isTpsKeyboardWanted`),
/// following whichever session is typing. A click on a cap types its glyph
/// through the session that shows the panel (`TpsKeyboardTarget`): the
/// Shift glyph from the cap's top half or with Shift held, the bare glyph
/// otherwise. A key the engine took — a click included — flashes its cap
/// (`flash`). Non-activating, so the click leaves the app being typed in
/// active and its text view focused — the way vChewing's candidate window
/// takes clicks (`CtlCandidateTDK4AppKit.swift:23`, `VwrCandidateTDK4AppKit.swift:169`).
///
/// The rows come from desktop-core (`KeyRules.tpsKeyboardRows`), built from
/// the TPS layout table, so the panel draws exactly what the keys type. The
/// same HUD chrome as the Telex guide; owned by the session that raised it,
/// the way the guide is, so a session on its way out cannot take down a
/// panel the incoming one just put up.
///
/// Placed at the bottom centre of the visible frame of the screen the mouse
/// is on — best effort for "the screen being typed on": activation may not
/// ask the client for a caret (`TaigiInputController.activateServer`), and
/// `NSScreen.main` in an input-method agent can be the primary display
/// whatever the user is looking at (`HUDPanel.noticeFrame`).
