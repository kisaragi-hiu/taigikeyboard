import AppKit
import KeyboardShortcuts
import SwiftUI

/// The Shortcuts pane of the settings window.
///
/// Three blocks, by what a key DOES: Candidate Selection, the keys that move through the
/// candidates; Output, the keys that end the composition into the document; and
/// Other, the switches and the windows a key raises. Titled since 2026-09-10 (USER) — the blocks shipped
/// headerless the same day, and a header is what tells a reader which of the
/// three a key they are hunting for lives in.
///
/// Not the split the pane had until 2026-08-21, which was two blocks divided
/// on which rows register a Carbon hotkey and which the key classifier reads.
/// That is an implementation detail, and a reader asked what it meant (USER).
/// The last boundary here falls in the same place — the switches are exactly
/// the actions with a global chord — but the first two blocks are both the
/// classifier's, so the boundaries as a set follow the actions rather than
/// the registries.
///
/// One CONTROL too, since 2026-08-26: every row is a `ShortcutKeyRecorder`.
/// The global rows were `KeyboardShortcuts.Recorder` until then, and it beeps
/// at any modifier-less key before validation of ours can run
/// (`RecorderCocoa.swift:404-410`) — so the Hanji/romanization swap could not be moved to a bare
/// `z` even though it SHIPS on a bare backtick (USER, real device). What the
/// two tiers still differ in is where the recorded key is written and what
/// each refuses on top of the shared gate, which is what `onRecord` and
/// `additionalRejection` carry.
///
/// No row writes its own chord: each recording goes through a `record`
/// handler, which resolves the conflicts it creates across BOTH registries
/// before the pane re-reads what that left. The two registries are the
/// composing bindings in `SettingsStore` and the global chords in
/// `KeyboardShortcuts`.
