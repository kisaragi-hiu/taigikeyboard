///
/// The controller keeps everything that is IMKit or AppKit: the client calls

/// actions. The core never touches a client; it records, and the controller
/// replays (D3, record-then-replay). One per process (`shared`): the engine
/// it drives is process-wide.
///
/// Every request but `activate` is for the session that owns the engine; one
/// from a session that does not is answered `nil` and does nothing — the
/// non-owner rule of `ComposingSessionCoordinator.owns`.

/// window's selection and slots, and the auto-space swap's client check.
