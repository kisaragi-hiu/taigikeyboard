//! What the desktop input methods keep on disk beyond the engine's user-data
//! stores: `settings.json` (and the settings windows' writer over it), the
//! user's copied-in fonts, and the directory each desktop platform hands in
//! (`%APPDATA%\TaigiKeyboard` on Windows, the XDG config / data directories
//! on Linux).
//!
//! The learning databases and the custom dictionary are the engine's
//! (`engine/userdata`, `docs/architecture/user-data-engine-roadmap.md`); the
//! desktops reach them through `taigi_desktop_core::engine::user_data`.
//!
//! Host-testable: nothing here touches a Windows API, so the tests run on
//! the Mac against temporary directories. Only `directory::user_data_directory`
//! reads `%APPDATA%`, and it is a pure environment lookup.
