//! The settings model: every persisted key, its default, the typed choices,
//! and the engine-facing snapshot derived from them.
//!
//! Persistence itself (the `settings.json` file, its atomic replace and the
//! mtime/revision reload) lives in `taigi-desktop-storage`; this module owns
//! the SHAPE of the document so the TIP and the settings window agree on it.
//! Key spellings are the iOS ones, as on macOS
//! (`macos/Sources/TaigiInputMethodCore/Settings/SettingsStore.swift:36-50`),
//! so `settings.json` speaks the same vocabulary as `defaults read` does on a
//! Mac and a future settings transfer has one name per setting.
//!
//! It also holds what both settings WINDOWS draw from, toolkit-neutral:
//! `presentation` (labels, links, page notices), `launch` (the command
//! line), `dictionary_sources` (that pane's roster), `dictionary_search`
//! (that pane's result limit and debounce) and `custom_dictionary` (that
//! pane's model, over the engine's user-data ops).
