//! The SettingsCard: the one shape every setting in the Windows 11
//! Settings app sits in (Windows Community Toolkit `SettingsCard`) — a
//! full-width card on the ground, 1px stroke, 4px corners, the setting's
//! name at the left and its control at the right. `action_row` puts a
//! command in that same shape: what it does at the left, the button that
//! runs it at the right.
//!
//! Every colour is a `ThemeBrush`, never a literal: light, dark and high
//! contrast are WinUI's to resolve.
