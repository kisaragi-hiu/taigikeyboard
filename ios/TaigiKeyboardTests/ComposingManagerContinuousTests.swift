/// v3.5.8 Phase 7B — `ComposingManager` Continuous-input wrapper tests.
///
/// Scope (per Codex consult 2026-05-10, session 019e11d7):
/// - One engine call per keystroke: every raw-input mutation
///   (`startComposing` / `appendCharacter` / `appendHyphen` /
///   `replaceLastCharacter`) leaves a composition `FetchAtPos` answers with
///   a candidates carrier — no separate promotion request (R12).
/// - `fetchContinuousCandidates()` is read-only — does not mutate `rawInput`
///   or `isComposing` (mirrors `RustEngineBridgeContinuousTests`).
/// - `commitContinuous` mid-commit stays in Continuous (pending tail remains
///   addressable); full-commit exits to Idle and clears mirror.
/// - `reset` from a composition returns to Idle and emits the abort
///   effect trio (`ClearPreeditWithoutCommit` + `ResetAutocomplete` +
///   `NextWordClearForNewComposing`).
///
/// Boundary coverage: `RustEngineBridgeContinuousTests` pins the FFI
/// contract; this file pins the `ComposingManager` observable-mirror +
/// effect-dispatch wrapper. UI integration (TaigiAutocompleteService /
/// ActionHandler tap decode) is verified by Codex post-impl + manual
/// dogfood — the wrappers are thin enough that mocking the keyboard
/// extension context for unit tests is not cost-justified.
