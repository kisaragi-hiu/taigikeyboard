/**
 * Persists user-created themes as a JSON list. I/O is injected via [read] /

 * store stays free of platform persistence APIs and is directly unit-testable.
 *
 * Cap: at most [MAX_USER_THEMES] themes (USER 2026-06-07). At cap, [add] no-ops
 * and returns false. Mirrors iOS UserThemeStore — Android persists via DataStore
 * JSON instead of an App Group file and bumps no revision counter (idle refresh
 * is handled by an appearance-republish Flow; see docs/ui/android-theme-port.md).
